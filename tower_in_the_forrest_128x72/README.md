This map is going to be the base map for my rpg session. It's still not finished and will receive a lot of changes in the future. 

Sadly the foundry vtt import file is too large for github.

To make changes to the dungendraft map, you need the [FA Dungeondraft Integration 3.0](https://www.patreon.com/posts/56375276) asset pack from [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.forgotten-adventures.net/).
